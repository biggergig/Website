    <b><br>Our project was a definite integral calculator.<br>
Our project worked, but only worked for correct inputs, however whenever the input would be slightly wrong, it would not work.<br>
To make my project better, I could have it work for erroneous inputs such as sin(x or sinx.<br>
To sell this product, I would have to show some sort of steps so that students could learn from the integral question.<br></b>
